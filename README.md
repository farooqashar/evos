# Early Verification of Signatures (EVOS)

This is a model deployment of the Early Verification of Signatures (EVOS) system. This is built using React.js and Node.js along with a Firebase Firestore database. This system allows government officials to add signatures to the database of signatures that the voter's signatures will be matched against. This system also allows any voter to enter their name and address along with uploading a picture of their ballot and get immediate feedback on whether it matches the signature on file.
